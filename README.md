# PiperUI

A user interface for creating voices with the Piper TTS.  
Uses the [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) for the text to speech, and [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) for the app theme / layout.

You will need to unzip the contents of [Piper (Windows 64 zip)](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases/download/2023.11.14-2/piper_windows_amd64.zip) to your local `\bin\Debug\net7.0-windows` folder that is created when you Clean , Rebuild the solution.
