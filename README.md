# This fork
** This fork is a work in progress, as such it is not ready to be used! **
I will update this readme file when it is ready to be tested by the public.
This is my contribution to refactor the app to properly use the mvvm patern and seperate all the logic from the views.
Most of this is done now.

I will add a task list when I can.

# PiperUI

A user interface for creating voices with the Piper TTS.  
Uses the [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) for the text to speech, and [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) for the app theme / layout.

The executable zip for the application is in the Releases: [PiperUI](https://github.com/natlamir/PiperUI/releases/download/v1.2.0/PiperUI.zip)
